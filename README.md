In the past 3 years, I was working in a wuhan local team which have build unicorn company, two startups, acted as frontend Team Leader, tech manager. 

In the earlier 5 years I have worked as a full-time Senior Engineer for a US company remotely. We doing CISCO,twilio,tropo related IVR and call center product on the AWS cloud.

In the past 15+ year, I continue doing web programming as a full-stack developer using java and javascript.

I prefer to find a job that work as full-time and able to build the long-term connection. I want to focus on one thing or one project/product.  

I treat my work output seriously, I am always responsible.  I get pretty good remark in every projects I did, I make sure every project completed successfully.

I am the experienced veteran always fight in the trench, I like coding. I also developed 3 Indie game in my spare time.
